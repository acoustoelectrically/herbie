  <p>The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
  Herbie 2.0! This release focuses clarity, transparency, and trade-offs.</p>

  <p><b>What is Herbie?</b> Herbie automatically improves the accuracy
  of floating point expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and
  surprises that so often occur with floating point arithmetic.</p>

  <p><b>Join us!</b> Join the Herbie developers on the
  <a href="https://fpbench.org">FPBench</a> Slack, at the monthly
  FPBench community meetings, and at
  <a href="https://fpbench.org/talks/fptalks22.html">FPTalks 2023</a>.

  <h2>Speed-accuracy trade-offs</h2>

  <p>
  Two years releases ago, Herbie 1.5 added a new <kbd>--pareto</kbd>
  mode, which let Herbie suggest some alternatives that were accurate
  but slow, and others that were faster but less accurate. In this
  release, we've made this mode the default. In order to do that, we
  had to make it faster, clearer, and more reliable. We think making
  speed-accuracy trade-offs are a key part of using Herbie in a
  practical context, and we're excited to make that easier for users.
  </p

  <h2>New Metrics and Redesign</h2>

  <p>
  We've cleaned up the report page significantly. The visual redesign
  is the most notable---we've' refreshed and standardized the new
  fonts, colors, and spacing. But more importantly, we've switched
  to <a href="error.html">a new way</a> of measuring accuracy and
  speed, which we think will be more intuitive for users and avoid
  some misconceptions we see users run into.
  </p>

  <h2>Derivations</h2>

  <p>
    Herbie can now explain step by step how it transformed your
    original input into the final program. This helps you understand
    how Herbie works, and potentially help us identify bugs or
    misbehaviors.
  </p>

  <h2>Foundations for a Herbie Workbench</h2>
  
  <p>
    We&apos;ve started building a prototype numerics workbench,
    codenamed "Odyssey". As part of that, this release contains the
    beginnings of a <a href="api-endpoints.html">REST API</a> for
    interacting with Herbie. Long-term, the goal is an interactive,
    task-oriented interface for improving the accuracy of
    floating-point expressions, leveraging Herbie but also potentially
    other tools. A prototype is currently available in the VS Code
    store as the <kbd>herbie-vscode</kbd> plugin.
  </p>

  <h2>Other improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Inputs whose real-valued result rounds to floating-point
      infinity are now considered valid. This changes Herbie&apos;s
      accuracy estimates, sometimes significantly, but we found that
      typically this yields better results
    <li>Most sections of the Herbie reports page now have "help" links
      directly to the relevant section of the documentation.
    <li>Many, many algorithms within Herbie have been sped up.
      Notably, pruning, regimes, and binary search have all seen
      significant speedups.
    <li>Graphs are now drawn using JavaScript, on the client side,
      making them higher resolution, especially on high-DPI displays.
    <li>Herbie&apos;s localization pass was written to be more
      accurate on tricky cases, which improves Herbie&apos;s results.
    <li>Herbie&apos; supports for the <code>tgamma</code>
      and <code>lgamma</code> functions was rewritten to be more
      accurate (though it is quite slow).
  </ul>

  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We want Herbie to be more useful to scientists, engineers, and
    programmers around the world. We've got a lot of features we're
    excited to work on in the coming months. Please
    <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/herbie/issues">report bugs</a>
    or <a href="https://github.com/uw-plse/herbie">contribute</a>.
